## AP CSA Freedom Project

For my AP CSA project, I have decided to create a game, a rather unique and immersive game that takes in details from our Tool Unity. The freedom project itself allows anybody who participates in creation of it to make anything they truly desire, and for this year there are no limits to what you can make. For my project I will be working with Jaiden Ahamed and Safe Nasher to make our dream of a cool immersive game a reality. We each tinker in our own ways and time and for myself I have decided that I was going to install the Unity editor so I can actually create empty project templates
