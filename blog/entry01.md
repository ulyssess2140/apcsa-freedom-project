## AP CSA Freedom Project

For my AP CSA project, I have decided to create a game, a rather unique and immersive game that takes in details from our Tool Unity. The freedom project itself allows anybody who participates in creation of it to make anything they truly desire, and for this year there are no limits to what you can make. For my project I will be working with Jaiden Ahamed and Safe Nasher to make our dream of a cool immersive game a reality. We each tinker in our own ways and time and for myself I have decided that I was going to install the Unity editor so I can actually create empty project templates. When I first opened up the empty project under the 3D section I was horrified by the complexity of Unity, so many variables to take care of in order to create something in 3D. But thats why I have the internet, for I began researching beginner guides in order to even start. The tutorials ranged from importing Unitys many tools like the terrain extension which helps the user optimize and create flora (like plants and realistic trees). I havent started coding yet because of how I wanted to plan tinkering with the complexity of Unity itself but I can safely say this is the road to our creation of a test project before we even think of the main game. In the Engineering Design Process, there are many levels to it that must be thought of in order to effectively create a solution to a problem (or rather idea in this scenario) for it. In the EDP, we are currently defining, researching and brainstorming ideas (1-3) to tackle the problem of making the complex game we so desire. Some skills picked up along the way was beginning to understand Unity and it's controls. A person who has never heard of Unity before looking at an empty project would cry in fear looking at the many variables to a 3D game. Fortunately for me I started getting comfortable and hopefully will remain that comfortable for the research I plan on doing this upcoming week.
