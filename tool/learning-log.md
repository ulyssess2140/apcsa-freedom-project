Throughout this week, I have been planning and finding ways to help prepare myself with the creation of my project. While my partners Safe and Jaiden have been finding ways to help in their own ways, I have been trying to learn Blender in order to help myself make more realistic objects and animations if and where necessary. Blender itself is an open source software that allows you to render and model basically anything your 3D mind desires. All those sick 3D animations are because of blender and continue to get better with more exposure to the software. I decided to give it a try and see how difficult or easy it would be to use this software.

This is the animation page where although it doesn't seem like much, I made very simple smiling faces and tried my best with animation. There were so many things to press and change that I had no idea what I even needed to start with. Fortunately, I figured something out myself in which I can just pull the times these smiling faces appear and disappear. I am not so good if not good at all with animation so the fact that the 2nd smaller face appeared and disappeared was a win for me. And with that, I have some sort of knowledge that can serve useful later if necessary
