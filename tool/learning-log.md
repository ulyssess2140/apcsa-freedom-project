Throughout this week, I have been planning and finding ways to help prepare myself with the creation of my project. While my partners Safe and Jaiden have been finding ways to help in their own ways, I have been trying to learn Blender in order to help myself make more realistic objects and animations if and where necessary. Blender itself is an open source software that allows you to render and model basically anything your 3D mind desires. All those sick 3D animations are because of blender and continue to get better with more exposure to the software. I decided to give it a try and see how difficult or easy it would be to use this software. Upon opening the software itself, I was given options to create new directories to build and create, where general takes you to it's default canvas, 2D animation for animating (in the 2D), Sculpting lets you make any 3D object with a circle (I tried this and didn't know any of the tools so I made a flat oval, it wasn't even flat it was rugged), and video editing to edit any videos you'd like.

This is the animation page where although it doesn't seem like much, I made very simple smiling faces and tried my best with animation. There were so many things to press and change that I had no idea what I even needed to start with. Fortunately, I figured something out myself in which I can just pull the times these smiling faces appear and disappear. I am not so good if not good at all with animation so the fact that the 2nd smaller face appeared and disappeared was a win for me. And with that, I have some sort of knowledge that can serve useful later if necessary (You may not see it but on the bottom are 2 lines that run the animation. There are small little diamonds that represent when the animation (or the drawing) come into the canvas. I messed around with it and somehow got it to appear and disappear)

As I continue working with Blender, I'd like to try to implement these skills with the Unity map I am also working on. My next plan moving forward is to discuss with my partners what and how to work on blender and merge idea's together. I should also get to finishing the bare minimum of the map and implement the finishing animation to our character because he can only really walk forward and flies when moving left, right, and backwards. Other than that, I believe it should be smooth sailing from here
